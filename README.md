    Before that, I completed my B.Tech in CSE from SRMIST, India with a GPA of 9.58/10.0
    <br>It was where I learnt my coding skills and got nurtured,
    <br>and completed 3 full-time internships as SDE and a <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10127556">research paper</a>.

  <summary><b>:telescope: 2023 goal</b></summary>
  I've started my Master and Columbia University in Computer Engineering and would want to make some great networking connections. In tech stack I would want to complete my Full Stack goal by learning Swift for iOS app development and work more on Web3 projects.

   My 2022 goal was to get into <a href="https://www.mitacs.ca/en/programs/globalink/globalink-research-internship">MITACS GRI </a>and work on a research project. I was fortunate to go to University of New Brunswick and work on HRI projects on Jackal Robot. I even completed my SDE intern at <a href="https://quinence.com/">Quinence</a> and worked with Remix-run framework.
